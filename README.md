# Inception-CRO
This repository hosts the master's final project which investigates optimizing a single Inception module using Coral Reef Optimization (CRO). The project aims not only to enhance the module's efficiency and flexibility in image classification tasks but also contributes to the GreenAI initiative by reducing the computational resources required through the optimization of smaller, more efficient architectures.

## üå± Motivation
Optimizing a single Inception module can offer significant improvements in performance and efficiency, making it particularly suitable for environments where computational resources are limited. The focus on a single module also aligns with GreenAI principles by aiming to reduce the environmental impact of large-scale AI computations.

## Objectives
- To develop a highly flexible and optimally configured Inception module using Coral Reef Optimization.
- To validate the performance improvements in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy.
- To contribute to GreenAI by demonstrating how targeted optimizations can lead to more sustainable AI practices.
